Iteration: explore a lot of different ideas, different versions <br>
Interaction: communication and engagement, people <-> automated systems, refer [*The concept of “interaction” in debates on human–machine interaction*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02060-8)<br>

WHO interacts?<br>
HOW do theese subjects interact? <br>
for WHAT REASON is interaction taking place?<br>
under WHAT CONDITIONS (WHERE) is interaction taking place?<br>

ONE key interaction, the simpel the interesting, the better<br>
refer: [teenage engineering](https://teenage.engineering/), [play date](https://play.date/), *Katamari Damacy* (video game)<br>
AGENCY: user ability to perform meaningful actions and have a sense of control; their choices translate into real changes;actively engage; create a sense that user decisions matter and impact the outcome<br>
PERSONALITY: how you define the soft robotics, refer [superflux](https://superflux.in/#): [Our friends x electric](https://superflux.in/index.php/work/friends-electric/#)<br>
FEEDBACK<br>
INPUT/OUTPUT<br>

### Exercise 1
list of possible areas or specific situations where your soft robot could be used or interact within a home environment, focus on where the robot could be placed* and how it might interact with the surroundings<br>

Places
- corner, a place easy to be ignored but always importation for useless things
- door/wall/anyplace can hang things, these are more like free spaces in domestic place that must exist but most of the space on them is not used as the main function (eg, door mainly using the handle but not on door), so its available and free for adaption
- on table, jsut as a normal object
- under the bed or by bedside, ignored, random, handy
- in closet as a canbinet, most of them are turned into that way
- along the daily routine

### Exercise 2
list of potential interactions and geed back mechanism of the robot<br>

Interaction, input/output
- grow, generate into shapes that hold handy things, flexible
- play sound, to remind, or to show the existence
- light, shine as the lamp but function in different way
- heat, a little bit critical, but to avoid the handy and random use
- viberate, can be either 1 of upper 3
- movement, move following the usual daily routine of the owner of the house, to become handy 
- connect, connect with all the misused objects, contact? communicate with them or link them together, like the main brain of the IoT
- time length of the owner staying in room or putting something on it
- message
- gesture
- adapt, when thrown onto some messy things or corner, 

### Exercise 3
Using your ideas from exercises 1 and 2, write a short paragraph in markdown that describes what your soft robot does, where it resides in the home, and who it interacts with. Feed this text to an AI and begin an iterative process to refine your concept.
Following this, create a series of quick prototypes that summarize the key points from your concept and your conversations with the AI.<br>
AIs can be used: huggingChat, chatGPT, v0, Gemini, etc.<br>

## 2024-10-22

focus on interaction<br>
start looking at robots, interactions<br>
research, exploration<br>

STORYBOARD/SCENARIO: the experience people lived through the whole interaction, be more detailed and include all the stages; can do paper prototype and record the interaction; think of your robot as a story <br>
IN SUMMARY FROM YOUR SCENARIO WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
- WHERE - Where does exist?
- WHO- For who is it?
- WHAT - What is it? What does it do?
- HOW - How does it behave? How do people get the information they need?How do they interact with it? How does it communicate?
- WHY - Why does it exist?

recommened refer from Chakir: [More unremarkable and odd places in Mario 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SybPxb_DjZ4&t=519s)<br>
3rd proto most promising, nudging, prompt from user, different types of prompting and nudging, a lot of possibilities, play with the ideas <br>
fill the gap, collabrating with other objects and create new one; but Suglue already<br>
4th idea: randomness still working with the overlooked corners, viberation, interactive, input some significance into it, not obvious, the tapping is interesting, like a reset<br>
feel like different transformations from one dough<br>

**Comments from profs and researchers after the presentation**<br>
a story in narrative interpretation<br>
[the Death of the Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author) >> the Death of the Designer<br>
kill the designer or try to have more control on the people by misleading them? kill the designer but inviting more designers<br>
infinite design because of unfinished design, unfinished objects to people and they need to finish the objects, a lot of experiments<br>
Maybe a next-step after deconstructing the designer = author, would be to look at Michel De Certeau’s The Practice of Everyday Life: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life
https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/De_Certeau_Michel_The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life.pdf (Creative Consumption, personalized usage -> secondary production)<br>
personalized exercises: kill one and invite more, think about cues nudging people<br>

**comments from LK** <br> 
do i want the collection still be used? or soft robot<br>
chain/spine in the one hand, other combinition idea? or how the virety itself can achive <br>

brainstorming of the forms it can have:

## final shape???????
### Shape based on cones
main basic gestures:
- Upright (bottom facing down, the most stable)
- Inverted (top facing down, unstable, but interesting motion).
- Lay sideways (bottom line in contact with the ground, great use playing with combination of edge and surface).
- Leaning (top against the wall, bottom edge on the ground, use external support to demonstrate how its geometric symmetry produces different contact forms).
- Hanging (by hanging the top or bottom of the cone, the natural vertical posture guided by gravity).
- Rolling

possibilities of addition:
- Tumbler design (adding weights to the bottom so that the eccentric cone will return to the upright position no matter how it is placed).
- Top-mounted center of gravity (adding weights to the top of the cone to make it more stable when inverted, showing mechanical balance under the guidance of the center of gravity).
- Side-weight experiment (adding weights to the side to see how the stability changes of the cone at different tilt angles).
- Dynamic tilt (installing movable weights, such as balls, inside the cone to make it show dynamic balance at different tilt angles).
- Magnetic balance? (using magnets to absorb the top or bottom of the eccentric cone so that it can rotate or tilt freely in a suspended state).
- Eccentric link (connecting multiple eccentric cones in series to make them like a chain/spine, and see how the motion can be achieved).
- Collision experiment (using multiple eccentric cones to roll or collide to observe their paths and movement patterns).
- Light and shadow experiment (using lights to place cones at different angles to observe the changes in shadows cast by their eccentric shapes).

![shape.png](pic/shape.png)

### Movement and Interaction
for the single cones:
- seperate and combine
- viberation while tapped

for combined ones?:
- stretch and extention > move (refer: spines, [miurakit](https://interactive-structures.org/publications/2023-07-miura-kit/))


**comments from LK and AM**
cones that wait for others to use<br>
shape - good, interesting<br>
make them playful, eg, when cover something (placed upright) , it will viberate to fall down, when placed inverted, it will scream(make sound) etc<br>
make (possibilities)
1. one that reacts differently to differnt interactions; 
2. a collection that reacts in same sense to different interactions; refer [collection objects](https://youtu.be/v68xoidR2FA?si=nC-dEITUZ5j8EbV-)
3. a collection of cones(robots) that reacts differently to different interactions; <br>
Pavlov's Dog, the first experimenting part 

interactions and feedback
| possible interactions | sensor | feedback | reason |

Press it|pressure  sensor
~~Spin/Rotate it~~
Stack it|IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor
Balance objects
Slide/Move it|motion sensor

Wrap or decorate it | pressure sensor
Put objects on/in it (Use it as a container)|IR Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Sensor
Trace its shadow
~~Insert objects into it~~
Create sound | sound sensor
Clash it with others
Light it | light sensor | runaway/move | run away from light

| possible feedbacks | how to realize |
|---|------|
Light emission: light on, blink, light-code | LEDs
Color change | LEDs or paper machanism with paper in different colors
Temperature change 
Texture transformation
Elastic deformation
Soft touch response
sound feedback
Self-balancing
Wobbling
Spinning 
Weight redistribution
Scent release
Mobile app connection
Data display
Social connectivity: Emits signals when it "detects" another cone nearby, encouraging collaborative play.
Random response
Delayed reaction
Simulated life: Pulsates or vibrates slowly at rest, mimicking a "breathing" sensation.

**comments from researchers and DES and LK**
Introduce more function or sense / or staying creative and playful? 
With a Collection of input and output you can tell a lot of different stories
Fake-it demo 
Interesting that you don’t know which cone is doing what
Use scenarios cases
Species? on the ocean -> kids play with it, sometimes in a harsh way
Secret silent code 
Affordance of the object is really interesting 
A lot of possibilities 
Do something your partner won’t see the all thing
Divination machine
The other one is moving because one was touched? 
Douglas likes the cut
experience
keep each thing simple

**general feedback**
network<br>
do more and better with less<br>
balance of input and output<br>
interacting with physical materials there<br>
why soft robots innteresting, the elephant, difficult to control<br>
experiment the prototype with as much interaction with people as you can, open up possibilities<br>
learning algorithm/dimension? think about it for the future, adding the learning out of the interactions from people, enrich the proto, soft behavior/programming, more music-like programming, no strict definition, open object, people helping with the definition/identity<br>
previous step to next step<br>

## 2024-12-05
**comments from LK and Pablo (a saving-my-life conversation)**<br>
network: numbers of the cones - the more the better, for a system of showing, maybe 3 of each?
- audio 3
- light 3
- motion 3 (dc motor/viberation motor)

connect all together, more usage in remote control, use micro controllers:
- arduino bluetooth (can connect without wifi)
- ☆ wifi-based ESP 8266 board (better)

workflow: start from making one for each or one type first<br>

### The highlighted part:
Light:
- single:
    - tap it - fade in and fade out
    - ? different side, different color
    - cover something - always on (like a lamp)
    - invert it - quick blink
    - light it - will on for seconds
    -? light it with different light - absorb light and show the same color (we are [light catchers](https://web.archive.org/web/20170717144505/http://www.michaelang.com/project/lightcatchers), [true color sensors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160816170307/http://www.mazet.de/en/products/jencolor/true-color-sensors))
    - make sound - light with the frequency of sound input
- network:
    - tap a code on A - B blink the code
    - convert A - B quickly blink with A

Motion: 
- single:
    - tap it - low-intensity buzz, like a small acknowledgment
    - press it - gradual vibration buildup to emphasize increasing pressure
    - cover something - rotate
    - make sound - vibrate with the frequency of sound input 
- network:
    - rotate A - B rotates in the opposite direction to A
    - tap A - B, C, D... vibrate mimicing the vibration intensity of A’s tap

test days
- observe but dont guide 
- write down the objectives: why these tests? what do i want to test? what hypotheses i want to confirm
- who and why audience?
- list tasks/interactions that need to be test - make a script
- plan technical setup - film? audio record? picture?
- welcome and intro -> pre-test interview -> moderation and observation -> post-test questionnaire
- open-end question (what do you think) not opinion
- take notes

**comments from DES**<br>
print a 3d plastic cone and coat it with paper<br>
test faking, eg. [Tesla says](https://youtu.be/oGbrQPSWrNc?si=h_bpE4ORMBM6pKjS )<br>

- [x] same session (同一大类下的锥) totally the same or **different**?
- [x] better choice for batteries
- [x] same for different board?? - same
- [x] self made touch sensor - need conductive surface? - some cones, add patterns
- [ ] only one analog pin on each ESP8266 -?

*the Testday Coneic: LED, tilt sensor, photocell, wireless?*

storybook:
![storybook](storybook/testday1.png)
![storybook](storybook/testday2.png)

still TODO and TOBUY repack for test day:
- [x] more complicated and random code (tilt and photocell only)
- [ ] battery
- [x] storybook print and cut

## 2024-12-18 TEST DAY
test days in mind
- observe more
- why, what, when, who, where, how
- film? audio record? picture?
- welcome and intro -> pre-test interview -> moderation and observation -> post-test questionnaire
- open-end question (what do you think) not opinion
- take notes

### Feedbacks
storybook part:
- tags confusing(feel like guidelines), make them into a book/or a website showing difgitally
- leave blank pages, place a pencil or digital apple pencil to encourge engagement
- consider adding scene/settings/backgrounds to different books, eg:
    - stroybook1 (story from a family), 
    - storybook2 (story of the coneics in a shared appartent)
    - storybook3 (story of remote connection)
    - ...
- stimulate the review pages of products, with username, product bought, star rating ☆☆☆☆, comment "..."
- consider to use a opening performance(小剧场表演) to help the audiences understand

Coneic:
- ? add filters for them
- each should have one main function/feedback, so that people can see the different personalities
- reference: [sphero](https://sphero.com/): codable robot
- question: what if someone discovers an interaction and feedback, but he doesn't like it??
    - a pet or a tool? people wont be mad at pet, but mad at tools if not useful
    - add a reset button?
    - prepare backup plan code for the coneics
- different types
