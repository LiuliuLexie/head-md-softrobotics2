## Storybook

"One day I left home early and felt in a bad mood, but my partner was still asleep, i don't know I felt like I didn't want to directly write my feeling to her so I left our Coneic inverted on the table, leaving the message."

"I always just leave my Coneic there by bedside as a little lamp, it's not too strong and it turns off when the daylight shines in."

"my Coneic is definitely in a troubled adolescence. It shakes every time I use it to cover something. it just doesn't want to be there."

"Thank you Conetic as a cute little physical phone between our family. Everyone in our family, my parents, my partner and my child, bring one by hand every day, you will never imagine how big comfort we get from the small vibrations from others."

"I never realized how much I relied on my Coneic until one night when it turned itself off, unprompted, after I laid it on the shelf. It’s like it knew I needed some space to think. I don’t need to say a word, but it understands me better than most."

"Every time I tap my Coneic, it’s like a gentle response. No words, just a soft vibration that tells me, ‘I see you.’"

"I watched my Coneic light up last night in the dark, just a faint glow, and I swear it felt like a tiny star in the room. It wasn’t the bright, harsh kind of light. It was gentle—like the way the moonlight touches the earth, just enough to feel seen without being overwhelmed."

"I laughed when my Coneic blinked red after a loud sound. It felt almost like it was caught up in the moment, mimicking the energy of the room. I never thought something so small could reflect the intensity of a single moment, but it does."

"This morning, I tapped my Coneic lightly before leaving. By the time I got to work, I felt it buzz back—my partner must have picked it up. It’s our little way of saying, ‘I’m thinking of you.’"

"When I pressed down on my Coneic after a long, frustrating day, it slowly built up a deep vibration. It felt like it was echoing my tension, then releasing it into the air. Strange, but I felt a little lighter."

"I noticed today that when I covered my Coneic with a book, it started spinning, almost like it was trying to shake off the weight. It makes me laugh every time—so dramatic for something so small."

"Our Coneics have become like a secret language. Yesterday, my daughter tapped hers in a rhythm, and mine blinked the same code back. It’s like our little game, but also… it feels like magic."

"At night, I whisper to my Coneic. It lights up faintly, pulsing in rhythm with my voice. I don’t know why, but it makes me feel like I’m heard, even when I’m alone."

"We placed our Coneics on the table during dinner, and every time someone spoke louder, they glowed brighter. It felt like the room was alive, capturing all our laughter and chatter in light."

"I inverted my Coneic by mistake this morning, and it blinked furiously, scolding me like a little guardian. Sometimes, I think it knows me better than I know myself."

"The other night, I sang softly to my Coneic, and it pulsed gently in tune. It reminded me of holding my baby years ago, rocking him to sleep with a lullaby."

"I carry my Coneic in my bag everywhere. When I’m nervous before meetings, I tap it, and it buzzes back like a friend whispering, like saying, ‘You’ve got this.’"

"I think my friend and I get Coneics of different personalities, hers feels like an irritable husky, it barks a lot, jumps a lot, very dynamic, but mine feels like a golden British shorthair cat, usually stays quiet and even I act intensively emotionally, it just light gently"

"We were playing a little game as a family. I rotated my Coneic, and suddenly, the one in my child’s hand spun gently in response, as if mirroring me. It’s fascinating how these small objects create a dance of light and movement, as though they share a secret language that only we can interpret."

"When I was away on a work trip, I sent a signal from my Coneic before bed—a small series of taps. The next morning, I woke up to a notification on my phone that our home Coneics had lit up and vibrated. My family had sent their response back, a silent reassurance that I wasn’t so far away after all."

"The emergent storm outside had us all in different corners of the apartment, but I tapped my Coneic in the dim room. A moment later, I saw the lights across the hallway respond—flickering and vibrating in sync. It wasn’t much, but in that moment, it felt like a reminder that we were all connected despite the howling winds."

"I don't know what it is, it is as stubborn as a stone and never responds, bullsh*t product!"

"I'm a test user of the Coneics, to observe more clearly, I turned on the flashlight towards one of them, and suddenly, all the lighted Coneics were on. I don't fully understand what they are doing, but it was an interesting scene."
