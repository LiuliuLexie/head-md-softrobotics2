## Storybook2

"One day I left home early and felt in a bad mood, but my partner was still asleep, I put the Coneic upside down on the table when I left for work. I didn’t have the words to explain how I felt to my partner, but I think she understood when she saw our inverted conetic. Message left."

"I keep mine by my bedside—it’s perfect as a little lamp. The light is soft, not too bright, and it switches off when daylight streams in. It’s white with a slightly matte finish, which makes it blend into the room like it belongs there. Honestly, it feels like a functional art piece."

"My Coneic is definitely in a troubled adolescence. Whenever I use it to cover something, it shakes, like it’s throwing a tiny tantrum. I don’t know if it’s part of the design or just mine acting up, but it’s kind of funny. Despite its moods, it’s become part of my daily routine."

"I'm a test user of the Coneics, to observe more clearly, I turned on the flashlight towards one of them, and suddenly, all the lighted Coneics were on. I don't fully understand what they are doing, but it was an interesting scene."

"It’s like having a little messenger in the family. My parents, my partner, and even our kid carry theirs around. The soft vibrations feel like a warm hug across the distance. They’re well-built, and the texture is pleasant to the touch. That said, I do think the price is a bit steep for something so small, but it’s worth it for the connection it brings."

"One night, it switched off on its own after I left it on the shelf. I didn’t notice at first, but it felt like it understood I needed some quiet. I know it’s just an object, but moments like that make it feel alive. It’s simple, white, and soft to the touch, but there’s so much more to it than meets the eye."

"Tapping my Coneic always feels like a conversation. No words, just the gentle hum of acknowledgment. It’s lightweight and easy to carry around, which is great, but sometimes I wish it were just a little sturdier."

"Last night, I noticed its faint glow in the dark—soft, not overbearing. It felt like a little star keeping me company. It’s not the cheapest gadget I’ve ever bought, but it’s one of the most calming things I own."

"I laughed when my Coneic blinked red after a loud sound. It felt almost like it was caught up in the moment, mimicking the energy of the room. I never thought something so small could reflect the intensity of a single moment, but it does."

"Before leaving this morning, I tapped it lightly. Later, I felt it buzz back in my bag. My partner must’ve picked it up—our little way of saying, ‘I’m thinking of you.’ It’s moments like this that make me love it, even if I initially thought it was a bit overpriced."

"After a rough day, I pressed down on it, and the vibrations built up gradually, like it was absorbing my tension. When it stopped, I realized I felt lighter. It’s not just a quirky design—it really feels like it has a purpose."

"I put a book on mine, and it started spinning as if to shake it off. Dramatic, but it always makes me smile. It’s little things like this that remind me why I bought it. Well-designed, functional, and surprisingly entertaining."

"Our family bought a collection of two. My daughter tapped hers in a rhythm, and mine mirrored it. It’s become a secret language between us. It’s amazing how such a simple object can create moments of joy."

"Sometimes I whisper to it at night. The faint pulsing glow feels like a quiet, comforting response. It’s oddly therapeutic, like having a presence in the room without the noise."

"During dinner, they glowed brighter whenever someone laughed or spoke loudly. It felt like they were capturing the energy of our conversations. The white, slightly soft material makes them easy to clean too, which I appreciate."

"I flipped it over by mistake, and it blinked furiously at me—like a tiny guardian with a strong opinion. It’s a bit sensitive, but I like that it responds to how I interact with it."

"I don't know what it is, it is as stubborn as a stone and never responds, bullsh*t product!"

"I sang to it softly, and it pulsed along, almost like a duet. It reminded me of rocking my baby to sleep. It’s simple moments like these that make it feel so special."

"I carry it everywhere. When I get nervous, a quick tap sends it buzzing back. It’s like a silent cheerleader. The material is smooth and pleasant to hold, and it’s lightweight enough to toss in my bag without a second thought."

"I bought one for myself and bought another for my friend as her birthday present. My friend says hers is like an excitable puppy—jumpy and loud. Mine? Definitely a lazy cat—calm, soft, and unbothered. I didn’t expect each one to feel so unique."

"We were playing with them as a family, and when I rotated mine, my kid’s mirrored the movement. It’s like they share a secret dance. I never thought something so simple could bring so much joy."

"On a work trip, I sent a few taps before bed. The next morning, I woke up to a message: our home Coneics had lit up in response. It was a small but powerful reminder of home. For the price, I expected more functionality, but it’s the emotional connection that makes it worth it."

"During a storm, I tapped mine in the dim light. Across the hall, I saw others respond, glowing and buzzing faintly. Despite the chaos outside, it made us feel connected. It’s not just a product—it’s an experience."

"Honestly? I can’t figure it out. It just sits there like a stubborn rock. Maybe I got a faulty one, but so far, it’s just an expensive decoration."

"As a tester, I shone a flashlight on it, and suddenly all of them lit up. I don’t fully understand the logic, but it was mesmerizing. I hope the final product comes with more instructions."
